/// - Parameters:
///   - seconds: The duration in seconds `operation` is allowed to run before timing out.
///   - operation: The async operation to perform.
/// - Returns: Returns the result of `operation` if it completed in time.
/// - Throws: Throws ``taskTimedOut`` error if the timeout expires before `operation` completes.
///   If `operation` throws an error before the timeout expires, that error is propagated to the caller.
